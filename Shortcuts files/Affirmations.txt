I invite my mind to be still.
I forgive myself.
I am worthy of peace.
I am worthy of happiness.
I transcend negativity.
I am forgiving.
I breathe in relaxation and exhale worry.
I am calm.
I embrace myself as I am.
I release the past.
I let go what no longer serves me.
I believe in me.
My body is relaxed, my mind is calm and my soul is at peace.
I feel safe in my sleep.
I feel cozy, calm, and content.
